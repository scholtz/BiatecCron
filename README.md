# Biatec Cron Builder - Decentralized Scheduler

This is the backend and executor repo for the decentralized algorand scheduler.

Decentralized scheduler consists of the frontend blockly code builder where anyone can build their own logic. Person selects the start time and period how often the tasks should execute and execution fee in tokenized gold. User deposits funds to the escrow account. Anyone can execute the tasks from the escrow account when the times comes. Each execution event is logged in the escrow account transactions.

More detailed documentation: https://docs-scheduler.biatec.io/

## Executor competition

Anyone can execute the tasks. Successful executor will receive reward set in the smart contract.
